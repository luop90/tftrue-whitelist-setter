# TFTrue Whitelist Setter
Simple plugin that sets the convar tftrue_whitelist_id to the correct whitelist. 

No includes needed to compile, however [TFTrue](https://github.com/AnAkkk/TFTrue) is (obviously) needed on the server for this to work.

## Install
Either compile the source yourself, or grab the .smx file from the compiled/ folder.

## Usage
`sm_setwhitelist [UltiDuo|4s|6s|HL]` or use the chat equivalents.

Argument is not case sensitive. Must have ADMFLAG_GENERIC ("admin") to use.
